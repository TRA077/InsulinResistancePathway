# InsulinResistancePathway
This repository contains the MATLAB code and graphs for modeling the insulin resistance pathway in the liver. The model simulates the dynamics of glucose uptake by the liver in response to insulin, and it can be used to investigate the effects of insulin resistance on glucose metabolism.
# GlucoseConcentrationinBloodGraph
The graph depicts the variation of glucose concentration in the blood over time, simulated using the MATLAB code "Glucose_conc.m". The graph illustrates the dynamic behavior of glucose levels in response to insulin stimulation, showcasing the influence of insulin sensitivity on glucose uptake by the liver.
### Purpose of the Code
The MATLAB code "Glucose_conc.m" was developed to simulate the insulin resistance pathway in the liver. This pathway plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism, and its dysfunction can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. The simulation model helps in understanding the interactions between insulin, glucose, and the insulin resistance pathway.
### Insights Gained from the Graph
The graph provides valuable insights into the dynamics of glucose metabolism and the effects of insulin resistance:
### Normal Insulin Sensitivity:
Glucose concentration exhibits a rapid decline following insulin stimulation, indicating efficient glucose uptake by the liver.
The glucose concentration gradually plateaus, suggesting a balanced state between glucose uptake and release.
### Insulin Resistance:
Glucose concentration declines at a slower rate compared to normal insulin sensitivity, indicating impaired glucose uptake by the liver.
The glucose concentration stabilizes at a higher level, suggesting reduced glucose clearance from the blood.
### Predictive Value of the Graph
The graph can be used to predict the potential impact of insulin resistance on glucose homeostasis. A slower decline in glucose concentration and a higher stabilized level suggest a higher risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes.
### Comparison with Real Experiment
The simulated graph qualitatively resembles the glucose concentration profile observed in real experiments involving insulin administration. However, the specific values may differ due to variations in individual physiology and experimental conditions.
### Source for Real Experiment Graph
A representative real experiment graph can be found in the following research article:

### Range of Glucose Concentration
The normal range of fasting blood glucose concentration in adults is between 70 and 99 mg/dL. However, postprandial glucose levels can rise up to 140 mg/dL within two hours after eating. In individuals with insulin resistance or diabetes, these levels may exceed the normal range.
### Inference drawn:
#### Insulin resistance impairs glucose uptake by the liver: In individuals with insulin resistance, the decline in glucose concentration following insulin stimulation is slower compared to normal individuals. This suggests that insulin resistance leads to impaired glucose uptake by the liver, resulting in a slower clearance of glucose from the blood.

#### Insulin resistance leads to higher stabilized glucose levels: The glucose concentration stabilizes at a higher level in individuals with insulin resistance compared to normal individuals. This indicates that insulin resistance reduces the overall effectiveness of glucose clearance mechanisms, leading to a persistent elevation in blood glucose levels.

#### Insulin sensitivity affects glucose homeostasis: The comparison between normal insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance highlights the crucial role of insulin sensitivity in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Normal insulin sensitivity ensures efficient glucose uptake and clearance, while insulin resistance disrupts this balance, leading to hyperglycemia.

In conclusion, the graph generated from the MATLAB code "Glucose_conc.m" provides a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of glucose metabolism and the effects of insulin resistance. The insights gained from the graph can be used to predict the potential impact of insulin resistance on glucose homeostasis and inform strategies for managing diabetes.
