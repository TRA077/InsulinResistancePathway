# InsulinResistancePathway
This repository contains the MATLAB code and graphs for modeling the insulin resistance pathway in the liver. The model simulates the dynamics of glucose uptake by the liver in response to insulin, and it can be used to investigate the effects of insulin resistance on glucose metabolism.
